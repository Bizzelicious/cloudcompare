# CloudCompare 

## Why 

To know which service in on cloud provider correponds to another. Currently the project compare the biggest providers according to the Gartner: AWS, Azure and GCP. When another one pops out - I plan to add. 

## How to contribute

This is an open source project that I maintain and run under the letscompare.cloud domain. 

There are few ways to help:

1. Create and issue if you find a bug, wrong link in service description or if you just want to add new service or mapping. 
2. Contribute a PR to add new things to `services.json` or `mapping.json`. 
3. Contribute a PR to fix my javascript. I am not a coder and I am aware of my crappiness in js.
